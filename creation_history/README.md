# Creating a Django project

[Step-by-step guide](https://medium.com/@nick_damoulakis/a-step-by-step-integration-of-django-and-vue-js-8b70fe60aec3)

> Django is a free, open-source Python web framework that’s designed for developing and managing complex, secure, and database-driven websites, and Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework designed for creating dynamic user interfaces.

>Integrating Django with Vue.js allows developers to harness the full power of Django’s robust backend capabilities alongside Vue.js’s responsive frontend features. This combination greatly enhances web development efficiency by streamlining the process of building complex, interactive web applications that are both highly scalable and easily maintainable.
